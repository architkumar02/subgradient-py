\begin{itemize}
\item \verb'SPY' does not work well with equality constraints (yet).
\item Convergence behavior depends on the step sizes, so it is up to users to give a ``right'' step size rule.
\item Currently, \verb'SPY' cannot detect if the given problem is unbounded. Extending \verb'SPY' to detect unboundedness will be a great deal of work, but it will be useful.
\end{itemize}
