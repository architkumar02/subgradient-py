\begin{itemize}
\item The current system only supports scalar variables and scalar-valued expressions. It is desirable to have vectors and matrices.
\item Although \verb'SPY' has all the basic library functions, it will be useful to have more \verb'CVX'-like library functions.
\item Currently, \verb'SPY' cannot detect if the given problem is unbounded. Extending \verb'SPY' to detect unboundedness will be a great deal of work, but it will be useful.
\end{itemize}
