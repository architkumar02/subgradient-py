\\
We've implemented a Python package (SPY) that solves convex
optimization problems using subgradient methods. 
\\
Advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item The objective and constraints can be non-differentiable.
\item They can be used to solve extremely large problems, as they require
  very little storage.
\item They can be combined with primal or dual decomposition techniques to develop
  distributed algorithms.
\end{itemize}
